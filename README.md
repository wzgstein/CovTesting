This repository focuses on the challenge of Hypothesis Testing for Sample Covariance Matrices in ultra-high dimensional settings.

:warning: Note: This repository is currently under construction.

The initial section of Hypothesis_Testing_for_Covariance_Matrix_in_the_ultra_high_dimensional_setting.ipynb provides an illustrative walkthrough of the paper by X. Ding and Z. Wang titled "Global and local CLTs for linear spectral statistics of general sample covariance matrices when the dimension is much larger than the sample size with applications", available on arXiv: 2308.08646.

In addition to the above, we delve into:

One-sample hypothesis testing of covariance matrices using real-world data.
Two-sample hypothesis testing of covariance matrices.
Both of these topics form an integral part of our upcoming research.
